### Monkeys at Ronny Green's store recently escaped their cages and got ahold of the store website. It looks awful. Green is calling in pros to fix it. 
    
Green has provided a list of changes. 
    
Your job is to make these changes happen.
    
Take a look at the index.html file and help Ronny make the site look better. 
    
Using cut (ctrl+c) and paste (ctrl+p) will make much of this work go by faster.
